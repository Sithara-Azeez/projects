        <h2><strong>FACE SERUM OIL</strong></h2>
        <p><hr>Truly Vital Beauty Facial Serum Oil<hr>
            The ingredients create a trifecta of skincare goodness. A serum that will make your skin look so hydrated that you can rock the BARE FACE, RED LIPS trend whenever neededðŸ˜‰.
            <h3>Benifits are:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Argan oil is a smooth golden oil that is used as a base ingredient here which is one of the best oils for acne. Packed with omega fatty acids, vitamin E and linoleic acid. </li>
                <li>Jojoba oil mimics the skinâ€™s natural sebum, making it great for all kinds of skin. Acts as a protective barrier to prevent your skin from losing moisture.</li>
                <li>And hands down to my all time fav essential oil, the Lavender oil. It has great anti-inflammatory properties and improves concentration and has a calming smell.</li>
            </ul>
            All these oils have a Comedogenic (pore clogging) rating of ZERO! I also love these oils because they have amazing lightening properties good for wiping off scars and dark spots from your skin.<br>
           <br>
            This little bottle of homemade serum is a treat for your skin, hydrating it, reducing the scars, providing nutrients that help fight age and the list goes on.
